# RealTimeSpellCheck

This application uses a combination of Windows forms application and my previous SpellCheck project for real time spelling checks 
while typing in a text box.

The feature this application currently support are autocompletion based on frequency of the words being used and providing word 
suggestions for incorrect words.


There are detailed comments in the project
